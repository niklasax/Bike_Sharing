Result: On weekdays, the most common time to ride is between 7AM-9AM and 5PM-6PM. On weekends, the most common time to ride is more evenly dispersed between 10AM and 5PM. This is likely driven by work commute schedules.

Result: Broken out my Gender, Male and Female show same riding patterns but Men make up more of the rides overall (hence concentration in the same spot on both areas, but men having darker concentration).

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

In summary, we can tell from our Citibike data that the average user is Male, a subscriber to the service, will likely have a 4-6hrs ride duration and will most likely be riding on a Thursday.

Two additional vizualizations to perform:

1.) Trip duration vs. user type

2.) Age vs. Day of the week
